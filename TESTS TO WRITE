Tests to Write
============
Ensure MembershipInvitation gets an initiator regardless of the params order passed into the Joinable when it is created or updated
    -- MembershipInvitation params were blowing up if they are initialized before the user_id of the Joinable is initialized
    -- A similar problem happened when the Joinable is updated and an initiator is passed in (though the result was a silent fail)
